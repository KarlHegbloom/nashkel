;; NOTE: 
;; I was planning to implement "Left-leaning redâ€“black tree"
;; Ref: Left-leaning Red-Black Trees - Robert Sedgewick
;; Link: http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/talks/LLRB/LLRB.pdf
;; BUT
;; It's *NEVER* LLRB now, because of this discussion:
;; Ref: Left-Leaning Red-Black Trees Considered Harmful
;; Link: http://read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/notes/llrb.html

;; NOTE: This RB tree follows the algorithm from <<Introduction to Algorithm>>.

;; ====== Red Black Trees ======
;; 1. Every node has a value.
;; 2. The value of any node is greater than the value of its left child and less than the value of its right child.
;; 3. Every node is colored either red or black.
;; 4. Every red node that is not a leaf has only black children.
;; 5. Every path from the root to a leaf contains the same number of black nodes.
;; 6. The root node is black.
